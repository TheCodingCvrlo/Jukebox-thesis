# Extracting meaningful representaions from OpenAI's Jukebox
This repository collects code snippets that generate figures and results from my Bachelor of Science's final dissertation.

To reproduce results from the thesis, it is first necessary to extract song representations through https://github.com/p-lambda/jukemir.

Notebooks should then be used in the following order:
1. flatten_data_structure
2. spot_duplicates
3. filter
4. pca
5. sweeps
6. best_model_training
